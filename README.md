# Sequence-Generator
This project is a menu-driven C++ application for generating various sequences (geometric, Linear) and reversing strings. It focuses on using flow control structures.

## Features
- Generates a geometric sequence based on user-defined terms and common difference.
- Creates a counting sequence with custom start, stop, and step values.
- Reverses a user-provided string.
- Uses different loop structures for each sequence type.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1brah1m-aba512/Sequence-Generator.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd Sequence-Generator`
3. Compile the program: `g++ main.cpp -o Sequence-Generator`
4. Run the program: `./Sequence-Generator`

## Future Improvements
- Add additional sequence types.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
